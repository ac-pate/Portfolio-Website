## A Slightly Longer but More Accurate Timeline

### What I Thought I Wanted to Be (Top Row)

- 🦷 Dentist  
- 🔧 Tinkerer / Builder  
- 💻 Programmer  
- 🧠 Aspiring Chip Designer  
- ⚙️ Computer Engineering Student  
- 🤖 Robotics Engineer  
- 🚀 Robotics Researcher and Systems Engineer (in progress)

### Life Phases and Turning Points (Bottom Row)

- **Early Childhood Phase, India**  
  Wanted to be a dentist for reasons that no longer make sense.  
  That dream quietly disappeared.

- **Curious Kid Phase, India**  
  Didn’t know what career I wanted, but always wanted to build, take things apart, and tinker.  
  Creating things mattered more than the title.

- **High School Phase, India**  
  Discovered programming and realized I enjoyed making things work through code.  
  Considered Computer Science seriously.

- **Decision Phase, Montreal**  
  Chose Computer Engineering at Concordia over Computer Science because hardware mattered.  
  Became deeply interested in chip design and semiconductor manufacturing.

- **Semiconductor Focus Phase**  
  First internship at Microchip Technology.  
  Worked on high performance computing systems used in aerospace contexts, including NASA-related projects.  
  Learned a lot about chip design and manufacturing.

- **First Robotics Spark, Ego Included**  
  Entered my first robotics competition purely out of ego.  
  Built an autonomous sumo robot for Robowars.  
  It was my first real robotics project.  
  It didn’t work as planned, but I had way too much fun.

- **Realization Phase, Post Internship**  
  During and after the Microchip internship, realized something important.  
  I wanted to be the person *using* powerful computers, not the person manufacturing them.  
  This was the moment I **doubled down on robotics**.

- **Teaching and Foundations Phase**  
  Started working as a Teaching Assistant before internships.  
  TAed VHDL, programming basics, and electronics basics.  
  Strengthened fundamentals while continuing to build robots on the side.

- **Robotics Research Phase**  
  Research internship at Concordia Aerospace Robotics Lab.  
  Worked on aerospace rover systems.  
  Contributed to computer vision, localization, and navigation pipelines.  
  This experience locked in my interest in robotics research.

- **Competition Validation Phase**  
  Participated in multiple robotics competitions at the national level.  
  Won the Canadian Engineering Competition in March 2025.  
  This was the moment I **tripled down on robotics**.

- **Current Phase, Montreal**  
  Computer Engineering student focused on robotics and embedded systems.  
  Research experience, competitions, teaching, and projects all point in the same direction now.  
  Still building, still learning, still refining what kind of robotics engineer I want to be.
