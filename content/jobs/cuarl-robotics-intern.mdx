## Key Contributions

### ROS2 Control Stack Development

- Brought up and stabilized a ROS2 control stack for motor control over CAN (EPOS4)
- Integrated ros2_control/ros2_controllers with Virtual CAN workflow using ros2_canopen
- Enabled hardware-identical testing without the physical rover

### Simulation/Hardware Switching

- Implemented Xacro conditional plugin loading and launch-time arguments
- Removed manual config edits when moving between Gazebo simulation and real hardware
- Streamlined development workflow for the entire team

### Teleoperation System

- Built complete Xbox joystick teleoperation package
- Pipeline: Joy → Twist → diff-drive/skid-steer solver → Float64MultiArray → CAN
- Validated in Gazebo and on hardware during field trials

### Perception System

- Implemented perception-based position tracking for closed-loop experiments
- Used ZED2/ZED SDK and ArUco markers
- Achieved 20–30 Hz tracking with ROS2 message type integration for Simulink control stack
