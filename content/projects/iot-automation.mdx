## Overview

Led a team of 6 in transforming the IEEE Concordia club's workshop into a smart lab with fully self-hosted IoT infrastructure.

## Technical Stack

### Network Infrastructure
- Self-hosted IoT network (no cloud dependency)
- WiFi and Zigbee connectivity for diverse devices
- MQTT message broker for efficient communication
- InfluxDB for time-series data storage and analytics

### Custom Hardware
- Built custom WiFi and Zigbee IoT devices
- Custom sensors deployed throughout the lab
- Unified automation through Home Assistant

### Automation & Control
- Node-Red for optimized automation flows
- Voice control integration via Alexa
- Automated lab routines for energy efficiency

### Security System
- ML object detection on camera feeds
- Inference running on CORAL TPU for edge computing
- Automated control of lights, soldering irons, cabinet locks
- Real-time data-driven decision making
- Network security implementation throughout
