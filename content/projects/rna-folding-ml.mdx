## Overview

Course project for Evolutionary Algorithm and Machine Learning course focusing on RNA folding prediction.

## Problem Statement

Given a set of random RNA sequences, predict how each sequence will fold and determine which nucleotides can pair with each other in 3D space.

## Approach

- Developed custom ML model for sequence analysis
- Trained on known RNA folding patterns
- Predicted base pair probabilities
- Validated against known structures
