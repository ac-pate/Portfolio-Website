## Overview

Course project for ELEC 481 - Linear Systems, designing a PID, State Feedback Controller, and Full-Order $ Reduced-Order Observers for a 2-DOF torsional apparatus.

## Application

Simulating satellite docking or sub-module docking in space, specifically the torsional stress applied during connection.

## Technical Work

- State-space modeling of the 2-DOF system
- State-feedback controller design
- Full-order observer implementation
- Reduced-order observer implementation
- All work done in MATLAB/Simulink
