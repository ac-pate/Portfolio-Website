## Overview

Course project for Autonomy for Mobile Robots (ELEC 484) implementing Extended Kalman Filter for sensor fusion.

## Part 1: Trajectory Extraction
- Extracted vehicle trajectory from raw IMU/INS data
- Computed motion parameters and path reconstruction

## Part 2: EKF Implementation
- Implemented Extended Kalman Filter from scratch
- Fused IMU and GNSS measurements
- Achieved accurate real-time position estimation
- Handled sensor noise and uncertainty propagation
