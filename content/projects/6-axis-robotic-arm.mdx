## Overview

Leading a multidisciplinary team of 6 (MECH, ELEC, and SOEN students) in developing a modular, 3D-printed, 6-DOF robotic arm with a custom cycloidal actuator.

## Technical Details

### Mechanical Design

- Custom cycloidal actuator design for high torque density
- Fully 3D-printed modular construction
- 6 degrees of freedom for full workspace coverage
- Optimized for repeatability and precision

### Electronics

- CAN bus for robust single serial control of each joint
- ESP32 as the main hardware controller
- Jetson Nano as the solver and Dev Machine

### Software Stack

- ROS2 framework for control and coordination
- Precise closed-loop controller for each joint
- Inverse kinematic solver for 3D space retracing
- End-effector alignment system for precise manipulation

### Computer Vision Integration

- ML-based object detection using MediaPipe
- Computer vision running on Jetson Nano
- Real-time inference optimization for responsive control

## My Role

- Project lead overseeing task assignments and deliverables
- ROS2 setup and architecture decisions
- Integration of vision and control systems
- Mentoring team members in robotics software development
